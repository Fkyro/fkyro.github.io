## the_code.js is the part you need to use in TamperMonkey, the other .js file is just here to show how I get the value

## How is it working ?

## Disclaimer
Do not take my work for truth, it may be wrong. All my work here is based on assumption, on supposition I made while analysing the way things were evaluated. I personally think it's right but it wouldn't be the first time I'm absolutely wrong.

Just use it smartly, DO NOT make your choice of what exercise you will or won't do based solely on that. It is only an indicator.
